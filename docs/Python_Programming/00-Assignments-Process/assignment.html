      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Submit your assignment in your folder that has your ID number.</li>
        <li>Include all necessary files and documentation.</li>
        <li>Ensure your code is well-commented, linted and follows best practices.</li>
        <li><strong>If you use ChatGPT or any AI tools for assistance, make sure to understand the code fully and write your own explanation and comments.</strong></li>
        <li>Plagiarism or submitting AI-generated code without personal understanding may affect your evaluation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Evaluation and Academic Integrity</h2>
      <p>We acknowledge that AI tools like ChatGPT can be valuable for learning and problem-solving. However, the assignments are designed to assess your individual understanding and coding skills.</p>
      <p>Therefore:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use AI tools as a learning aid, not as a shortcut to complete assignments.</li>
        <li>All submitted code and explanations must reflect your own understanding.</li>
        <li>Trainers may ask follow-up questions or request code walkthroughs to ensure comprehension.</li>
        <li>Failure to demonstrate understanding or evidence of copying AI-generated solutions without learning will impact your grades.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We encourage ethical use of AI tools to enhance your learning experience.</p>

      <h2>Additional Resources</h2>
      <p>For assistance with Python programming or anything, try prompting ChatGPT with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><code>How do I write a for loop in Python?</code></li>
          <li><code>Explain Python functions with examples.</code></li>
          <li><code>What are Python data types and how do I use them?</code></li>
          <li><code>Help me debug this Python code: [paste your code here]</code></li>
          <li><code>How can I use list comprehensions in Python?</code></li>
          <li><code>Explain the difference between Python lists and tuples.</code></li>
          <li><code>What are Python decorators and how do I create one?</code></li>
          <li><code>Show me examples of Python classes and objects.</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Feel free to ask specific questions or request explanations, code snippets, or best practices.</p>
