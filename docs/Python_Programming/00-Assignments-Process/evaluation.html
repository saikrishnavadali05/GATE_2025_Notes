      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The purpose of assignment evaluation is to assess your understanding, coding skills, and ability to apply Python concepts effectively.</p>
      <p>Evaluations take into account multiple factors to ensure fair and transparent grading.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Your code should solve the given problem accurately, produce the expected output, and handle edge cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Readability:</strong> Maintain clean structure, proper indentation, and meaningful variable names.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation & Comments:</strong> Add clear comments to explain your logic and demonstrate understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Originality & Understanding:</strong> Ensure the work is your own. If you use AI tools, modify the output and make sure you can explain the logic.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use of AI Tools (e.g., ChatGPT)</h2>
      <p>We recognize that AI tools can enhance learning when used responsibly. To uphold academic integrity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use AI tools as a learning aid, for suggestions or debugging helpâ€”not for direct answers.</li>
        <li>Understand and modify any AI-generated code before submission.</li>
        <li>You are encouraged to include the prompts you used and explore multiple approaches to the same question.</li>
        <li>Copying AI-generated solutions without understanding or adaptation is discouraged and does not support your learning.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Write your own comments and explanations to reinforce concepts.</li>
        <li>Practice coding independently beyond AI-generated solutions.</li>
        <li>Review and test any code you get from external sources.</li>
        <li>Reach out to your trainers for support whenever needed.</li>
      </ul>
