  <h1>Chapter 7 Overview: Control Structures in Python</h1>
</header>

<section>
  <p>
    Control structures are fundamental building blocks in programming that allow you to dictate the flow of execution based on conditions or repetitions.
    In this chapter, you will learn about decision-making statements and looping constructs in Python which help in controlling the behavior of programs dynamically.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Topics Covered</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>If Statement:</strong> Execute code blocks based on a condition.</li>
    <li><strong>If-Else Statement:</strong> Provide alternative blocks of code when conditions are true or false.</li>
    <li><strong>If-Elif-Else Statement:</strong> Handle multiple conditions with several decision branches.</li>
    <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> Repeat code as long as a condition remains true.</li>
    <li><strong>For Loop:</strong> Iterate over sequences such as lists, strings, or ranges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Control Structures Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Using control structures allows programs to make decisions and perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Without them, programs would be limited to executing code linearly.
  </p>

  <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Syntax and usage of various conditional statements in Python.</li>
    <li>How to use loops to execute repetitive tasks.</li>
    <li>Writing clean, readable, and efficient control flow logic.</li>
  </ul>
