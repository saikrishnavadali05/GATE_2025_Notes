      <h2>Comparison of Python with Other Programming Languages</h2>
      <p>
        In this document, we will compare <strong>Python</strong> with other popular programming languages to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Python</strong> is often compared with languages like <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. 
        While all these languages have <strong>unique strengths</strong>, their suitability depends on the use case â€” <strong>Python</strong> excels in <strong>data science and scripting</strong>, <strong>Java</strong> is favored for <strong>robust cross-platform systems</strong>, <strong>C++</strong> is preferred for <strong>low-level performance</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> dominates <strong>interactive web applications</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Python</strong>: Known for its <strong>simple syntax</strong>, <strong>rapid development</strong>, and <strong>extensive libraries</strong>, especially in <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>web development</strong>, and <strong>data science</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Java</strong>: A <strong>statically typed</strong>, object-oriented language widely used in <strong>enterprise applications</strong> and Android development.</li>
        <li><strong>C++</strong>: A <strong>high-performance compiled language</strong> used in <strong>system-level programming</strong>, <strong>games</strong>, and <strong>real-time applications</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: The dominant language for <strong>front-end web development</strong>, also used on the server-side with Node.js.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges with Python</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Python is generally slower than compiled languages like C++ and Java.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Development</strong>: Python is not commonly used for mobile app development.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Consumption</strong>: Python can consume more memory compared to other languages.</li>
        <li><strong>Threading</strong>: Python's <strong>Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)</strong> can be a limitation for multi-threaded applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Runtime Errors</strong>: Python's <strong>dynamic typing</strong> can lead to runtime errors that are not caught at compile time.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Packaging and distributing Python applications can be more complex compared to languages that compile to standalone binaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Version Compatibility</strong>: Differences between <strong>Python 2</strong> and <strong>Python 3</strong> can cause compatibility issues in legacy codebases.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Access to Low-Level System Operations</strong>: Python abstracts many low-level details, which can be a limitation for system-level programming.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Despite these challenges, Python's <strong>extensive libraries and frameworks</strong>, along with its <strong>active community</strong>, make it a powerful tool for various applications.
