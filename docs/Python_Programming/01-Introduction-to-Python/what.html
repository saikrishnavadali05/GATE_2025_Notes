      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
        It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

      <h2>Architecture of Python</h2>
      <p>
        Python follows a simple architecture that includes the Python interpreter, standard libraries, and third-party libraries.
        The interpreter executes the code line by line, making it easy to debug and test.

        Python is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line by line at runtime. This allows for quick testing and debugging, but can also lead to slower execution compared to compiled languages.
        The Python interpreter translates the code into bytecode, which is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

        Python is built over C and C++ languages, which makes it a powerful language for system-level programming. 
        The reference implementation, CPython, is written in C, while some alternative implementations and performance-critical modules use C or C++ for efficiency. 
        This allows Python to interface with low-level system components and leverage existing libraries written in these languages.

        Besides CPython, other major Python implementations include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PyPy:</strong> An alternative implementation focused on speed, written in RPython, featuring a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.</li>
          <li><strong>Jython:</strong> A Python implementation for the Java platform, allowing Python code to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
          <li><strong>IronPython:</strong> Designed for the .NET framework, enabling Python integration with .NET libraries.</li>
          <li><strong>MicroPython:</strong> A lightweight implementation optimized for microcontrollers and embedded systems.</li>
        </ul>

        The architecture of Python consists of several components:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Python Interpreter:</strong> The core component that executes Python code.</li>
          <li><strong>Standard Libraries:</strong> A collection of modules and packages that provide pre-built functionality.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Libraries:</strong> Additional libraries created by the community to extend Python's capabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Python Virtual Machine (PVM):</strong> The runtime engine that executes the bytecode.</li>
          <li><strong>Bytecode:</strong> An intermediate representation of the source code that is executed by the PVM.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Programming in Python</h3>
      <p>
        <li><strong>Modules and Packages:</strong> Organized collections of Python code that can be reused across different projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE):</strong> Tools like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, and Visual Studio Code that provide a user-friendly interface for writing and debugging Python code.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Environments:</strong> Isolated environments that allow developers to manage dependencies for different projects without conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging Tools:</strong> Tools like pdb and logging that help identify and fix issues in Python code.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing Frameworks:</strong> Libraries like unittest and pytest that facilitate writing and running tests for Python code.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Tools like Sphinx and MkDocs that help create and maintain documentation for Python projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Systems like Git that help manage changes to Python code over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment Tools:</strong> Tools like Docker and Heroku that help deploy Python applications to production environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):</strong> Practices that automate the process of testing and deploying Python code to ensure quality and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Quality Tools:</strong> Tools like flake8 and black that help maintain code quality and consistency in Python projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Package Managers:</strong> Tools like pip and conda that help manage Python packages and dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Linters:</strong> Tools that analyze Python code for potential errors and style issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Formatters:</strong> Tools that automatically format Python code to adhere to style guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Static Type Checkers:</strong> Tools like mypy that check Python code for type errors without executing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Profiling Tools:</strong> Tools that analyze the performance of Python code to identify bottlenecks and optimize execution speed.</li>
