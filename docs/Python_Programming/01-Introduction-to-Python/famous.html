      <h2>Most Used Versions of Python</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Python 3.x</strong> is the current and most widely adopted version of Python. Among these, <strong>Python 3.8</strong> and <strong>3.9</strong> are particularly popular due to their enhanced performance and modern features, making them highly favored by developers across various domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key improvements in Python 3.8 include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assignment Expressions (Walrus Operator)</strong>: Allows assignment inside expressions, making code more concise.</li>
        <li><strong>Positional-Only Parameters</strong>: Improves function signatures for better API design.</li>
        <li><strong>F-String Debugging</strong>: Simplifies debugging with inline expressions inside formatted strings.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Performance</strong>: Various optimizations under the hood for faster execution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Python 3.9 introduced further enhancements such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dictionary Merge and Update Operators</strong>: Simplifies combining and updating dictionaries with <code>|</code> and <code>|=</code> operators.</li>
        <li><strong>Type Hinting Generics</strong>: More flexible and expressive type annotations.</li>
        <li><strong>String Methods</strong>: New string methods like <code>removeprefix()</code> and <code>removesuffix()</code> for cleaner string manipulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Improvements</strong>: Additional optimizations for standard library modules and core features.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="color: red;">
        <strong>Python 2.x</strong> officially reached end-of-life on <strong>January 1, 2020</strong>. This means it no longer receives updates or security fixes. Migrating to Python 3 is essential to take advantage of ongoing support, newer libraries, and modern language features.
      </p>
      <p style="color: red;">
        Overall, adopting the latest Python 3 versions ensures access to improved performance, enhanced syntax, better security, and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries that keep Python at the forefront of modern programming.
      </p>
