    <p>A quadratic form is a polynomial with terms all of degree two. Quadratic forms are widely used in optimization, statistics, and various fields of engineering and science.</p>
    
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A quadratic form in \( n \) variables is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2, which can be written in matrix notation as:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ Q(x) = x^T A x \]</p>
    <p>where \( x \) is an \( n \)-dimensional column vector, \( x^T \) is the transpose of \( x \), and \( A \) is an \( n \times n \) symmetric matrix.</p>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Consider a quadratic form in two variables:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 \]</p>
    <p>This can be written in matrix notation as:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ Q(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x & y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & \frac{b}{2} \\ \frac{b}{2} & c \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 \]</p>
    
    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>Some important properties of quadratic forms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> The matrix \( A \) in the quadratic form \( x^T A x \) is symmetric.</li>
        <li><strong>Definiteness:</strong> A quadratic form is said to be positive definite if \( x^T A x > 0 \) for all non-zero vectors \( x \), positive semi-definite if \( x^T A x \geq 0 \), negative definite if \( x^T A x < 0 \), and negative semi-definite if \( x^T A x \leq 0 \).</li>
        <li><strong>Eigenvalues:</strong> The definiteness of a quadratic form can be determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A \). If all eigenvalues are positive, the quadratic form is positive definite; if all are non-negative, it is positive semi-definite; if all are negative, it is negative definite; and if all are non-positive, it is negative semi-definite.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Canonical Form</h2>
    <p>A quadratic form can be transformed into its canonical form using an orthogonal transformation. This involves finding an orthogonal matrix \( P \) that diagonalizes \( A \), such that \( P^T A P = D \), where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix. The quadratic form then becomes:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ Q(x) = y^T D y \]</p>
    <p>where \( y = P^T x \).</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Quadratic forms are used in various applications, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Quadratic forms are used in quadratic programming and in finding the extrema of multivariable functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> In statistics, quadratic forms are used in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and in the formulation of test statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Quadratic forms are used to describe energy functions and in the study of conic sections and ellipsoids.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Quadratic forms are a fundamental concept in linear algebra with important properties and numerous applications. Understanding how to work with quadratic forms and their properties is essential for various fields of science and engineering.</p>
