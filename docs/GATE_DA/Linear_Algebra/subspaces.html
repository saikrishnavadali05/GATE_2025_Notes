    <p>In linear algebra, a subspace is a vector space that is wholly contained within another vector space. Subspaces are important in understanding the structure of vector spaces and their properties.</p>
    
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A subset \( W \) of a vector space \( V \) is called a subspace if \( W \) is itself a vector space under the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication defined on \( V \). Formally, \( W \) is a subspace of \( V \) if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The zero vector of \( V \) is in \( W \).</li>
        <li>For every \( u, v \in W \), the sum \( u + v \in W \).</li>
        <li>For every \( u \in W \) and every scalar \( c \), the scalar product \( cu \in W \).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Consider the vector space \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). Some examples of subspaces of \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The set containing only the zero vector: \( \{(0, 0, 0)\} \).</li>
        <li>A line through the origin, such as \( \{(x, 0, 0) \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \} \).</li>
        <li>A plane through the origin, such as \( \{(x, y, 0) \mid x, y \in \mathbb{R} \} \).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>Subspaces have several important properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Closed under addition:</strong> If \( u \) and \( v \) are in a subspace \( W \), then \( u + v \) is also in \( W \).</li>
        <li><strong>Closed under scalar multiplication:</strong> If \( u \) is in a subspace \( W \) and \( c \) is a scalar, then \( cu \) is also in \( W \).</li>
        <li><strong>Contains the zero vector:</strong> The zero vector of the larger vector space \( V \) is also in the subspace \( W \).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Basis and Dimension</h2>
    <p>The basis of a subspace is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the subspace. The number of vectors in the basis of a subspace \( W \) is called the dimension of \( W \), denoted as \( \dim(W) \).</p>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider the vector space \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) and the subspace \( W = \{(x, 2x) \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \} \). The set \( \{(1, 2)\} \) is a basis for \( W \) because it is linearly independent and spans \( W \). The dimension of \( W \) is 1.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Subspaces are used in various applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solving linear systems:</strong> Understanding the solution space of a system of linear equations.</li>
        <li><strong>Fourier analysis:</strong> Decomposing functions into orthogonal components.</li>
        <li><strong>Principal component analysis (PCA):</strong> Reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving variance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Subspaces are a fundamental concept in linear algebra that provide insight into the structure and properties of vector spaces. They are crucial for various applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.</p>
