    <p>Discrete distributions describe the probability of outcomes of a discrete random variable. Some common discrete distributions include:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Bernoulli Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest discrete distribution, describing a single experiment with two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0). The probability mass function (PMF) is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ P(X = x) = p^x (1 - p)^{1 - x} \]</p>
    <p>where \( p \) is the probability of success.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Binomial Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} \]</p>
    <p>where \( n \) is the number of trials, \( k \) is the number of successes, and \( p \) is the probability of success in each trial.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Poisson Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Poisson distribution describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \]</p>
    <p>where \( \lambda \) is the average number of events in the interval and \( k \) is the number of events.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Geometric Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Geometric distribution describes the number of trials needed to get the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ P(X = k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p \]</p>
    <p>where \( p \) is the probability of success in each trial and \( k \) is the trial number of the first success.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Negative Binomial Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Negative Binomial distribution describes the number of trials needed to achieve a specified number of successes in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ P(X = k) = \binom{k + r - 1}{r - 1} p^r (1 - p)^k \]</p>
    <p>where \( r \) is the number of successes, \( k \) is the number of failures, and \( p \) is the probability of success in each trial.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bernoulli Distribution:</strong> Modeling binary outcomes such as coin flips.</li>
        <li><strong>Binomial Distribution:</strong> Modeling the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, such as the number of heads in multiple coin flips.</li>
        <li><strong>Poisson Distribution:</strong> Modeling the number of events in a fixed interval, such as the number of emails received in an hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Geometric Distribution:</strong> Modeling the number of trials until the first success, such as the number of attempts needed to pass an exam.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative Binomial Distribution:</strong> Modeling the number of trials until a specified number of successes, such as the number of attempts needed to achieve a certain number of sales.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding discrete distributions is essential for modeling and analyzing events with discrete outcomes. Each distribution has its own unique characteristics and applications, making them powerful tools in probability and statistics.</p>
