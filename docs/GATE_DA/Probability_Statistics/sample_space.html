    <p>In probability theory, the sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Each outcome is an element of the sample space, and the sample space is denoted by \( S \) or \( \Omega \).</p>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. The sample space is:</p>
    <p>\[ S = \{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \} \]</p>
    
    <p>For rolling a six-sided die, the sample space is:</p>
    <p>\[ S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \} \]</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Sample Spaces</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discrete Sample Space:</strong> Contains a finite or countably infinite number of outcomes. Examples include the outcomes of rolling a die or tossing a coin.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Sample Space:</strong> Contains an uncountably infinite number of outcomes. Examples include the possible outcomes of measuring the height of a person or the time taken to complete a task.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>An event is a subset of the sample space. For example, in the experiment of rolling a die, the event of rolling an even number is:</p>
    <p>\[ E = \{ 2, 4, 6 \} \]</p>
    
    <h3>Union of Events</h3>
    <p>The union of two events \( A \) and \( B \), denoted by \( A \cup B \), is the set of outcomes that belong to either \( A \) or \( B \) or both. If \( A \) and \( B \) are events, then:</p>
    <p>\[ A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \} \]</p>
    
    <h3>Intersection of Events</h3>
    <p>The intersection of two events \( A \) and \( B \), denoted by \( A \cap B \), is the set of outcomes that belong to both \( A \) and \( B \). If \( A \) and \( B \) are events, then:</p>
    <p>\[ A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \} \]</p>
    
    <h3>Complement of an Event</h3>
    <p>The complement of an event \( A \), denoted by \( A' \) or \( A^c \), is the set of outcomes in the sample space that are not in \( A \). If \( A \) is an event, then:</p>
    <p>\[ A' = \{ x : x \in S \text{ and } x \notin A \} \]</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Probability Calculation:</strong> Sample spaces are used to define probabilities of events.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Sample spaces form the basis for conducting statistical experiments and analyses.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Sample spaces are used to model possible outcomes and assess risks in various fields such as finance and engineering.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The concept of sample space is fundamental to probability theory and statistics. It provides a framework for defining and analyzing events, calculating probabilities, and conducting experiments.</p>
