    <h2>Permutations</h2>
    <p>Permutations refer to the arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of \( n \) distinct objects taken \( r \) at a time is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!} \]</p>
    <p>where \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider 3 distinct objects: A, B, and C. The number of permutations of these 3 objects taken 2 at a time is:</p>
    <p>\[ P(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{(3 - 2)!} = \frac{3!}{1!} = 6 \]</p>
    <p>The permutations are: AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, and CB.</p>
    
    <h2>Combinations</h2>
    <p>Combinations refer to the selection of objects without regard to the order. The number of combinations of \( n \) distinct objects taken \( r \) at a time is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \]</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider 3 distinct objects: A, B, and C. The number of combinations of these 3 objects taken 2 at a time is:</p>
    <p>\[ C(3, 2) = \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \frac{3!}{2! \cdot 1!} = 3 \]</p>
    <p>The combinations are: AB, AC, and BC.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Permutations:</strong> Used in scenarios where the order of arrangement is important, such as seating arrangements, rankings, and schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>Combinations:</strong> Used in scenarios where the order of selection is not important, such as lottery draws, team selections, and combinations of flavors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding permutations and combinations is essential for solving problems related to counting and arrangement. These concepts are fundamental in probability and statistics, as well as in various real-world applications.</p>
