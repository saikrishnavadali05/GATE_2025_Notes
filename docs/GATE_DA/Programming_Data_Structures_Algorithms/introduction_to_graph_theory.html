    <p>Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is composed of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or arcs) that connect pairs of vertices.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vertex (Node):</strong> A fundamental unit of a graph, represented as a point.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge (Arc):</strong> A connection between two vertices, represented as a line.</li>
        <li><strong>Degree:</strong> The number of edges incident to a vertex. For a vertex \( v \), its degree is denoted by \( \deg(v) \).</li>
        <li><strong>Path:</strong> A sequence of vertices connected by edges, where each vertex is visited only once.</li>
        <li><strong>Cycle:</strong> A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no other repetitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Connected Graph:</strong> A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.</li>
        <li><strong>Subgraph:</strong> A graph formed from a subset of the vertices and edges of a larger graph.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> A graph in which edges have no direction. If there is an edge between vertices \( u \) and \( v \), it is denoted as \( \{u, v\} \).</li>
        <li><strong>Directed Graph (Digraph):</strong> A graph in which edges have a direction. If there is an edge from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \), it is denoted as \( (u, v) \).</li>
        <li><strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> A graph in which each edge is assigned a weight (or cost). The weight of an edge \( \{u, v\} \) is denoted as \( w(u, v) \).</li>
        <li><strong>Tree:</strong> A connected acyclic graph.</li>
        <li><strong>Bipartite Graph:</strong> A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Graph Representation</h2>
    <p>Graphs can be represented in various ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong> A 2D array in which the element at row \( i \) and column \( j \) indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \).</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacency List:</strong> An array of lists. The list at index \( i \) contains all the vertices adjacent to vertex \( i \).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider the following undirected graph:</p>
    <pre>
    A --- B
    | \   |
    |  \  |
    |   \ |
    C --- D
    </pre>
    <p>The adjacency matrix representation is:</p>
    <pre>
       A B C D
    A [0 1 1 1]
    B [1 0 0 1]
    C [1 0 0 1]
    D [1 1 1 0]
    </pre>
    <p>The adjacency list representation is:</p>
    <pre>
    A: B, C, D
    B: A, D
    C: A, D
    D: A, B, C
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Graphs are used to model computer networks, social networks, and communication systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Graphs model transportation networks such as roads, railways, and flight routes.</li>
        <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Graphs represent biological networks like neural networks and protein-protein interaction networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Operations Research:</strong> Graphs solve problems related to resource allocation, scheduling, and optimization.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Graph theory is a fundamental area of mathematics and computer science that provides powerful tools for modeling and solving complex problems. Understanding the basics of graph theory is essential for various applications in science, engineering, and industry.</p>
