    <p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It quantifies uncertainty and is used extensively in various fields such as statistics, mathematics, finance, science, and engineering.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Probability</h2>
    <p>The probability of an event \( A \), denoted by \( P(A) \), is defined as:</p>
    <p>\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \]</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider a fair six-sided die. The probability of rolling a 3 is:</p>
    <p>\[ P(\text{rolling a 3}) = \frac{1}{6} \]</p>
    
    <h2>Probability Axioms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> For any event \( A \), \( P(A) \geq 0 \).</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> The probability of the sample space \( S \) is 1, i.e., \( P(S) = 1 \).</li>
        <li><strong>Additivity:</strong> For any two mutually exclusive events \( A \) and \( B \), \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conditional Probability</h2>
    <p>The conditional probability of an event \( A \) given that event \( B \) has occurred, denoted by \( P(A \mid B) \), is defined as:</p>
    <p>\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]</p>
    <p>provided \( P(B) > 0 \).</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider a deck of 52 cards. The probability of drawing an Ace given that the card drawn is a spade is:</p>
    <p>\[ P(\text{Ace} \mid \text{Spade}) = \frac{P(\text{Ace} \cap \text{Spade})}{P(\text{Spade})} = \frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{13}{52}} = \frac{1}{13} \]</p>
    
    <h2>Bayes' Theorem</h2>
    <p>Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. It is given by:</p>
    <p>\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider a medical test for a disease. Let \( D \) be the event that a person has the disease and \( T \) be the event that the test is positive. Bayes' Theorem can be used to find the probability that a person has the disease given that the test is positive:</p>
    <p>\[ P(D \mid T) = \frac{P(T \mid D) \cdot P(D)}{P(T)} \]</p>
    
    <h2>Law of Total Probability</h2>
    <p>The law of total probability states that if \( \{B_i\} \) is a partition of the sample space \( S \), then for any event \( A \),</p>
    <p>\[ P(A) = \sum_{i} P(A \mid B_i) \cdot P(B_i) \]</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider a factory that produces widgets. The widgets can come from one of three machines. Let \( A \) be the event that a widget is defective, and let \( B_i \) be the event that the widget comes from machine \( i \). The law of total probability can be used to find the overall probability that a widget is defective:</p>
    <p>\[ P(A) = P(A \mid B_1) \cdot P(B_1) + P(A \mid B_2) \cdot P(B_2) + P(A \mid B_3) \cdot P(B_3) \]</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Probability is used to assess risks in finance, insurance, and engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Probability helps in making informed decisions under uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Probability forms the foundation of statistical inference and hypothesis testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Games and Gambling:</strong> Probability is used to analyze and strategize in games of chance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Probability is a fundamental concept in mathematics and statistics that provides a framework for quantifying uncertainty. Understanding probability is essential for analyzing random events and making informed decisions in various fields.</p>
