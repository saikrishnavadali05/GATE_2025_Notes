    <p>Permutations and combinations are fundamental concepts in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting, arranging, and grouping objects. These concepts are widely used in probability, statistics, and various fields of science and engineering.</p>
    
    <h2>Permutations</h2>
    <p>Permutations refer to the arrangement of objects in a specific order. The order of arrangement is important in permutations. The number of permutations of \( n \) distinct objects taken \( r \) at a time is given by:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!} \]</p>
    <p>where \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider the set of letters \{A, B, C\}. The permutations of these letters taken 2 at a time are:</p>
    <pre><code>AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB</code></pre>
    <p>The number of permutations is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ P(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{(3 - 2)!} = \frac{3!}{1!} = 6 \]</p>
    
    <h2>Combinations</h2>
    <p>Combinations refer to the selection of objects without regard to the order of arrangement. The number of combinations of \( n \) distinct objects taken \( r \) at a time is given by:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \]</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider the set of letters \{A, B, C\}. The combinations of these letters taken 2 at a time are:</p>
    <pre><code>AB, AC, BC</code></pre>
    <p>The number of combinations is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ C(3, 2) = \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3 \]</p>
    
    <h2>Difference Between Permutations and Combinations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Permutations:</strong> Order matters. The arrangement AB is different from BA.</li>
        <li><strong>Combinations:</strong> Order does not matter. The selection AB is the same as BA.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Probability:</strong> Used to calculate probabilities of different outcomes in experiments and events.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Applied in sampling techniques and hypothesis testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Utilized in algorithms, cryptography, and coding theory.</li>
        <li><strong>Operations Research:</strong> Used in optimization problems and resource allocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Applied in genetics for understanding possible combinations of genes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Permutations and combinations are essential tools in combinatorics, providing methods to count and arrange objects in various ways. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving problems in probability, statistics, computer science, and many other fields.</p>
