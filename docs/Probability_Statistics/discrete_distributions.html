    <p>Discrete distributions describe the probability of outcomes in a sample space where the outcomes are distinct and countable. These distributions are used to model scenarios where events occur in specific, separate states.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Discrete Distributions</h2>
    <p>Several important discrete probability distributions are commonly used in statistics:</p>
    
    <h3>Binomial Distribution</h3>
    <p>The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (binary experiments). Each trial has two possible outcomes: success or failure. The probability mass function (PMF) is given by:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} \]</p>
    <p>where \( n \) is the number of trials, \( k \) is the number of successes, and \( p \) is the probability of success in each trial.</p>
    
    <h3>Poisson Distribution</h3>
    <p>The Poisson distribution describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \]</p>
    <p>where \( \lambda \) is the average rate of occurrence, and \( k \) is the number of occurrences.</p>
    
    <h3>Geometric Distribution</h3>
    <p>The geometric distribution describes the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ P(X = k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p \]</p>
    <p>where \( p \) is the probability of success in each trial, and \( k \) is the trial on which the first success occurs.</p>
    
    <h3>Negative Binomial Distribution</h3>
    <p>The negative binomial distribution describes the number of trials needed to achieve a specified number of successes in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ P(X = k) = \binom{k - 1}{r - 1} p^r (1 - p)^{k - r} \]</p>
    <p>where \( r \) is the number of successes, \( k \) is the number of trials, and \( p \) is the probability of success in each trial.</p>
    
    <h3>Hypergeometric Distribution</h3>
    <p>The hypergeometric distribution describes the probability of \( k \) successes in \( n \) draws from a finite population of size \( N \) containing \( K \) successes, without replacement. The PMF is given by:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N - K}{n - k}}{\binom{N}{n}} \]</p>
    <p>where \( N \) is the population size, \( K \) is the number of successes in the population, \( n \) is the number of draws, and \( k \) is the number of successes in the draws.</p>
    
    <h2>Properties of Discrete Distributions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Probability Mass Function (PMF):</strong> Describes the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.</li>
        <li><strong>Expected Value (Mean):</strong> The average or mean value of the distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> The set of values that the random variable can take.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Used to model the number of defective items in a batch.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Models the number of claims or occurrences of events.</li>
        <li><strong>Ecology:</strong> Models the count of species or individuals in a given area.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Models the number of occurrences of diseases or health conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Operations Research:</strong> Applied in queuing theory and inventory management.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Discrete distributions are essential tools in probability and statistics, providing models for countable outcomes. Understanding these distributions and their properties is crucial for data analysis, decision-making, and predictive modeling in various fields.</p>
