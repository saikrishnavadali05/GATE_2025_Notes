    <p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves formulating a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, then using statistical evidence to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
    
    <h2>Steps in Hypothesis Testing</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Formulate Hypotheses:</strong> Define the null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) and the alternative hypothesis (\( H_1 \)).</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Significance Level:</strong> Select a significance level (\( \alpha \)), commonly set at 0.05 or 0.01.</li>
        <li><strong>Collect Data:</strong> Gather sample data and calculate the test statistic.</li>
        <li><strong>Determine Critical Region:</strong> Identify the critical region based on the chosen significance level and the distribution of the test statistic.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Decision:</strong> Compare the test statistic to the critical region to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Types of Hypothesis Tests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>z-test:</strong> Used to test the mean of a population when the population variance is known and the sample size is large (\( n > 30 \)).</li>
        <li><strong>t-test:</strong> Used to test the mean of a population when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small (\( n \leq 30 \)).</li>
        <li><strong>chi-squared test:</strong> Used to test the independence of two categorical variables or the goodness of fit of an observed distribution to an expected distribution.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Example: One-Sample z-test</h2>
    <p>Suppose we want to test whether the average height of a population is 170 cm. We collect a sample of 50 individuals with a mean height of 172 cm and a known population standard deviation of 5 cm.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Formulate Hypotheses</h3>
    <p>\[
    \begin{align*}
    H_0 &: \mu = 170 \\
    H_1 &: \mu \neq 170
    \end{align*}
    \]</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Choose Significance Level</h3>
    <p>Let \( \alpha = 0.05 \).</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Collect Data</h3>
    <p>Sample mean (\( \bar{x} \)) = 172 cm, population standard deviation (\( \sigma \)) = 5 cm, sample size (\( n \)) = 50.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Determine Critical Region</h3>
    <p>Calculate the test statistic:</p>
    <p>\[
    z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{172 - 170}{5 / \sqrt{50}} \approx 2.83
    \]</p>
    
    <h3>Step 5: Make Decision</h3>
    <p>For \( \alpha = 0.05 \), the critical values are \( \pm 1.96 \). Since 2.83 > 1.96, we reject the null hypothesis.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Medical Research:</strong> Hypothesis testing is used to determine the effectiveness of new treatments or drugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Hypothesis testing is used to assess whether products meet certain standards or specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> Hypothesis testing is used to make decisions based on sample data about consumer preferences and behaviors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Hypothesis testing is a fundamental tool in statistics that allows researchers to make data-driven decisions and draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. Understanding the steps and types of hypothesis tests is crucial for conducting and interpreting statistical analyses.</p>
