    <p>The sample space is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It represents the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Understanding the sample space is crucial for defining events and calculating probabilities.</p>
    
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>The sample space, often denoted by \( S \) or \( \Omega \), is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Each individual outcome is called a sample point or an element of the sample space.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Sample Spaces</h2>
    <p>Sample spaces can be classified into two main types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discrete Sample Space:</strong> Contains a finite or countably infinite number of distinct outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Sample Space:</strong> Contains an uncountable number of outcomes, often representing measurements on a continuous scale.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    
    <h3>Example 1: Coin Toss</h3>
    <p>For a single coin toss, the sample space is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( S = \{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \} \)</p>
    
    <h3>Example 2: Rolling a Die</h3>
    <p>For rolling a six-sided die, the sample space is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \} \)</p>
    
    <h3>Example 3: Drawing a Card</h3>
    <p>For drawing a single card from a standard deck of 52 cards, the sample space is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( S = \{ \text{Ace of Hearts}, \text{2 of Hearts}, \ldots, \text{King of Spades} \} \)</p>
    
    <h3>Example 4: Measuring Temperature</h3>
    <p>For measuring the temperature in a room, assuming it can take any real value, the sample space is continuous and can be represented as:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( S = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x \leq b \} \)</p>
    <p>where \( a \) and \( b \) are the minimum and maximum possible temperatures.</p>
    
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>An event is a subset of the sample space. It represents one or more outcomes of the random experiment. For example, in the case of rolling a die, an event could be rolling an even number:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( E = \{ 2, 4, 6 \} \)</p>
    
    <h2>Venn Diagrams</h2>
    <p>Venn diagrams are often used to represent sample spaces and events. Each outcome in the sample space is represented by a point, and events are represented by regions within a closed curve.</p>
    
    <h2>Complement of an Event</h2>
    <p>The complement of an event \( A \), denoted by \( A^c \), is the set of all outcomes in the sample space that are not in \( A \). For example, if \( A \) is the event of rolling an even number on a die, then:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( A^c = \{ 1, 3, 5 \} \)</p>
    
    <h2>Union and Intersection of Events</h2>
    <p>The union of two events \( A \) and \( B \), denoted by \( A \cup B \), is the set of outcomes that are in \( A \), \( B \), or both. The intersection of \( A \) and \( B \), denoted by \( A \cap B \), is the set of outcomes that are in both \( A \) and \( B \).</p>
    <p>For example, if \( A \) is the event of rolling an even number and \( B \) is the event of rolling a number greater than 3 on a die, then:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( A \cup B = \{ 2, 4, 5, 6 \} \)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( A \cap B = \{ 4, 6 \} \)</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Theory:</strong> Analyzing all possible outcomes in strategic games.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Defining the space of all possible outcomes before calculating probabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Identifying all potential outcomes of financial decisions or investments.</li>
        <li><strong>Operations Research:</strong> Evaluating possible outcomes in optimization problems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The sample space is a crucial concept in probability, serving as the foundation for defining events and calculating probabilities. Understanding and correctly identifying the sample space is essential for accurate probability analysis and statistical inference.</p>
