    <p>Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that describe the center or typical value of a dataset. The three most common measures of central tendency are:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Mean</h2>
    <p>The mean (or average) is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is calculated as:</p>
    <p>\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i \]</p>
    <p>where \( N \) is the number of values and \( x_i \) are the values.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Median</h2>
    <p>The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending order. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Mode</h2>
    <p>The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have more than one mode if multiple values have the same highest frequency.</p>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider the dataset: \[ 3, 5, 2, 9, 5, 7 \]</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> \[ \text{Mean} = \frac{3 + 5 + 2 + 9 + 5 + 7}{6} = \frac{31}{6} \approx 5.17 \]</li>
        <li><strong>Median:</strong> When arranged in ascending order: \[ 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9 \], the median is \[ \frac{5 + 5}{2} = 5 \]</li>
        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The mode is 5, as it occurs most frequently in the dataset.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The mean is used to summarize the overall level of a dataset, such as average income or average temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Median:</strong> The median is used when the dataset contains outliers or is skewed, as it provides a better measure of central tendency in such cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The mode is used to identify the most common value in a dataset, such as the most common shoe size or most frequent test score.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding measures of central tendency is essential for summarizing and analyzing data. Each measure provides different insights into the data, making them valuable tools in statistics.</p>
