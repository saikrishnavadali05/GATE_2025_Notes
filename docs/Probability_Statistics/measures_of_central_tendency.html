    <p>Measures of central tendency are statistical metrics that describe the center point or typical value of a dataset. The three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. Each measure provides different insights into the data and is useful in various scenarios.</p>
    
    <h2>Mean</h2>
    <p>The mean, also known as the average, is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency and is defined as:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ \text{Mean} (\overline{X}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \]</p>
    <p>where \( n \) is the number of observations, and \( X_i \) represents each value in the dataset.</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider the dataset: \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}. The mean is calculated as:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ \overline{X} = \frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]</p>
    
    <h2>Median</h2>
    <p>The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider the dataset: \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}. The median is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">6 (since it is the middle value in the ordered dataset)</p>
    
    <p>For an even number of observations, consider the dataset: \{2, 4, 6, 8\}. The median is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\[ \text{Median} = \frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5 \]</p>
    
    <h2>Mode</h2>
    <p>The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all if all values are unique.</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Consider the dataset: \{2, 4, 4, 6, 8\}. The mode is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">4 (since it appears most frequently)</p>
    
    <h2>Comparison of Measures</h2>
    <p>Each measure of central tendency provides different insights and has its own strengths and weaknesses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> Affected by extreme values (outliers), but takes all values into account.</li>
        <li><strong>Median:</strong> Not affected by outliers, useful for skewed distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Best for categorical data and identifying the most frequent value.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> Used in calculating average scores, financial analysis, and general statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Median:</strong> Used in real estate to report housing prices, income distributions, and any skewed data.</li>
        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Used in retail for inventory management, understanding consumer preferences, and categorical data analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Measures of central tendency are fundamental in statistics, providing insights into the typical values within a dataset. Understanding the mean, median, and mode allows for a more comprehensive analysis and interpretation of data across various fields.</p>
