    <h1 id="shortest-path">Shortest Path</h1>
    <a href="programming_data_structures_algorithms.html" class="back-link">Back to Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms Topics</a>
    <p>The shortest path problem is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science, which involves finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. This problem has numerous applications in areas such as networking, geographic information systems, and operations research.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Several algorithms are used to solve the shortest path problem, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:</p>
    
    <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
    <p>Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It uses a priority queue to greedily select the vertex with the smallest known distance.</p>
    <pre><code>import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}
start_vertex = 'A'
distances = dijkstra(graph, start_vertex)
print('Shortest distances:', distances)</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h3>
    <p>The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph, even if the graph contains negative edge weights. It uses dynamic programming to iteratively relax the edges.</p>
    <pre><code>def bellman_ford(graph, start):
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
        for vertex in graph:
            for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():
                distance = distances[vertex] + weight
                if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = distance

    for vertex in graph:
        for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():
            if distances[vertex] + weight < distances[neighbor]:
                raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")

    return distances

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}
start_vertex = 'A'
distances = bellman_ford(graph, start_vertex)
print('Shortest distances:', distances)</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h3>
    <p>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. It uses dynamic programming to iteratively improve the shortest paths.</p>
    <pre><code>def floyd_warshall(graph):
    dist = {vertex: {vertex2: float('infinity') for vertex2 in graph} for vertex in graph}
    for vertex in graph:
        dist[vertex][vertex] = 0
        for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():
            dist[vertex][neighbor] = weight

    for k in graph:
        for i in graph:
            for j in graph:
                dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])

    return dist

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}
distances = floyd_warshall(graph)
print('Shortest distances between all pairs:', distances)</code></pre>
