    <p>Linear search is a straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the target element is found or the list ends. It is also known as sequential search.</p>
    
    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <p>The linear search algorithm operates as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start at the first element of the list.</li>
        <li>Compare the current element with the target element.</li>
        <li>If the current element matches the target, return the index of the current element.</li>
        <li>If the current element does not match the target, move to the next element.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2-4 until the target element is found or the list ends.</li>
        <li>If the target element is not found in the list, return -1.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider the list \([4, 2, 7, 1, 9]\) and a target value of 7. The linear search algorithm proceeds as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Compare 4 with 7 (not a match).</li>
        <li>Compare 2 with 7 (not a match).</li>
        <li>Compare 7 with 7 (match found at index 2).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Python Implementation</h2>
    <pre><code>def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9]
target = 7
result = linear_search(arr, target)
print('Target found at index:', result)</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>The time complexity of linear search is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the list. In the worst case, the algorithm has to check each element in the list once.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Small Lists:</strong> Linear search is effective for small lists where the overhead of more complex algorithms is not justified.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsorted Lists:</strong> Useful when the list is unsorted, as other more efficient search algorithms require sorted lists.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding a Specific Element:</strong> When the position of the target element is unknown and needs to be found.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Linear search is a simple and intuitive search algorithm that is useful for small or unsorted lists. While it is not the most efficient search algorithm for large datasets, it is easy to implement and understand, making it a valuable tool for certain applications.</p>
