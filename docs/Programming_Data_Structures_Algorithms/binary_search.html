    <h1 id="binary-search">Binary Search</h1>
    <a href="programming_data_structures_algorithms.html" class="back-link">Back to Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms Topics</a>
    <p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until the possible locations are reduced to just one.</p>
    
    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <p>The binary search algorithm operates as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the beginning and end of the list, respectively.</li>
        <li>Calculate the middle index as \( \text{mid} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} \right\rfloor \).</li>
        <li>Compare the target value with the middle element of the list:
            <ul>
                <li>If the target value is equal to the middle element, return the index of the middle element.</li>
                <li>If the target value is less than the middle element, set high to \( \text{mid} - 1 \).</li>
                <li>If the target value is greater than the middle element, set low to \( \text{mid} + 1 \).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider the sorted list \([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\) and a target value of 7. The binary search algorithm proceeds as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Initial low = 0, high = 6, mid = 3. The middle element is 7.</li>
        <li>7 is equal to the middle element, so the target value is found at index 3.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Python Implementation</h2>
    <pre><code>def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
target = 7
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f'Target found at index: {result}')</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>The time complexity of binary search is \( O(\log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the list. This is because the search interval is halved in each step, leading to a logarithmic number of steps.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Searching in Sorted Arrays:</strong> Binary search is commonly used for searching elements in sorted arrays or lists.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Lookup:</strong> Used in databases and libraries where quick lookup operations are needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Optimization:</strong> Binary search is used in various algorithms to optimize performance, such as finding the optimal solution in optimization problems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Binary search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science for efficient searching in sorted lists. Understanding binary search and its implementation is crucial for solving many problems that involve searching and optimization.</p>
