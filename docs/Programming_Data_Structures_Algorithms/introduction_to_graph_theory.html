    <p>Graph theory is a branch of mathematics and computer science that studies the properties and applications of graphs. Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects. They are widely used in various fields, including computer science, biology, social sciences, and more.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Graph</h3>
    <p>A graph \( G \) is defined as an ordered pair \( (V, E) \), where \( V \) is a set of vertices (or nodes) and \( E \) is a set of edges (or links) that connect pairs of vertices.</p>
    
    <h3>Vertices and Edges</h3>
    <p>Vertices are the fundamental units of a graph, representing objects or entities. Edges are the connections between vertices, representing relationships or interactions between the objects.</p>
    
    <h3>Types of Graphs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> A graph in which edges have no direction. The edge \((u, v)\) is identical to \((v, u)\).</li>
        <li><strong>Directed Graph (Digraph):</strong> A graph in which edges have a direction. The edge \((u, v)\) is not identical to \((v, u)\).</li>
        <li><strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> A graph in which edges have associated weights or costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Unweighted Graph:</strong> A graph in which edges do not have weights.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple Graph:</strong> A graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.</li>
        <li><strong>Multigraph:</strong> A graph that may have multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Representation of Graphs</h2>
    <p>Graphs can be represented in several ways:</p>
    
    <h3>Adjacency Matrix</h3>
    <p>An adjacency matrix is a \( V \times V \) matrix \( A \) where \( A[i][j] \) is 1 if there is an edge from vertex \( i \) to vertex \( j \), and 0 otherwise.</p>
    
    <h3>Adjacency List</h3>
    <p>An adjacency list is an array of lists. The \( i \)-th list contains all vertices adjacent to the \( i \)-th vertex.</p>
    
    <h3>Incidence Matrix</h3>
    <p>An incidence matrix is a \( V \times E \) matrix \( B \) where \( B[i][j] \) is 1 if vertex \( i \) is incident to edge \( j \), and 0 otherwise.</p>
    
    <h2>Graph Traversal</h2>
    <p>Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting all the vertices in a graph in a systematic manner. Two common graph traversal algorithms are:</p>
    
    <h3>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3>
    <p>BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from a given source vertex and visiting all its neighbors before moving on to the next level. It uses a queue to keep track of the vertices to be explored.</p>
    
    <h3>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3>
    <p>DFS explores the graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack (or recursion) to keep track of the vertices to be explored.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Computer Networks:</strong> Modeling and analyzing network topologies, routing algorithms, and communication protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Networks:</strong> Analyzing relationships and interactions between individuals, detecting communities, and studying influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Modeling biological networks such as protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, and ecological networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Operations Research:</strong> Solving optimization problems such as the shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and network flow problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Representing and solving problems in knowledge representation, planning, and reasoning.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Graph theory provides a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing complex relationships and interactions. Understanding the basic concepts and algorithms of graph theory is essential for solving a wide range of problems in computer science and other fields.</p>
