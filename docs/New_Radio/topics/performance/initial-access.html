<h1>Initial Access Procedures</h1>

<button class="accordion">What is 5G NR?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    5G NR (New Radio) is the global standard for a new air interface developed by 3GPP for the 5th generation of mobile networks. It is designed to support faster data rates, ultra-low latency, and massive device connectivity.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Why 5G NR?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB):</strong> High-speed internet for applications like 4K video and AR/VR.</li>
    <li><strong>Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC):</strong> Real-time control for autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC):</strong> Supports IoT devices in smart cities and industries.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Key Differences from 4G</button>
<div class="panel">
  <ul>
    <li>Flexible numerology and slot structures</li>
    <li>Use of millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum</li>
    <li>Support for network slicing</li>
    <li>Built-in support for beamforming and Massive MIMO</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Spectrum Usage</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    5G operates in multiple frequency bands:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sub-1 GHz:</strong> Good coverage (rural)</li>
    <li><strong>1–6 GHz:</strong> Balanced coverage and capacity</li>
    <li><strong>mmWave (24+ GHz):</strong> Very high capacity (urban, dense environments)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Global Standardization</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    5G NR is being standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The first official specification was part of 3GPP Release 15, with enhancements in Release 16 and 17.

<button class="accordion">Real-world Applications</button>
<div class="panel">
  <ul>
    <li>Smart factories and automation</li>
    <li>Connected vehicles (V2X)</li>
    <li>Telemedicine and remote healthcare</li>
    <li>Cloud gaming and immersive media</li>
  </ul>
