<h1>Frequency Ranges in 5G NR</h1>

<button class="accordion">Overview of 5G Spectrum</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    5G NR operates in two main frequency ranges defined by 3GPP:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>FR1:</strong> 410 MHz to 7.125 GHz (Sub-6 GHz)</li>
    <li><strong>FR2:</strong> 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz (mmWave)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">FR1 (Sub-6 GHz)</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Frequency Range 1 is suitable for wider coverage and better penetration through buildings. These are typically reused 4G LTE bands and new 5G-specific mid-bands.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: n78 (3.5 GHz), n41 (2.6 GHz), n28 (700 MHz)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">FR2 (mmWave)</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Frequency Range 2 is known as millimeter wave (mmWave) and supports ultra-high bandwidth for applications like AR/VR and massive video streaming. However, it has limited range and poor penetration.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: n257 (26 GHz), n258 (28 GHz), n260 (39 GHz)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Spectrum Allocation by Country</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Spectrum allocation varies by country based on regulatory authorities. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>India:</strong> 700 MHz (n28), 3.3–3.67 GHz (n78), 26 GHz (n258)</li>
    <li><strong>USA:</strong> 600 MHz (n71), 2.5 GHz (n41), 28 GHz (n261)</li>
    <li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3.4–3.8 GHz (n78), 26 GHz (n258)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Carrier Aggregation</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    5G supports carrier aggregation across frequency ranges to boost throughput. For example, combining FR1 and FR2 allows both coverage and speed.
