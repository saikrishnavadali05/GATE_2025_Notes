    <h1>Atomic Habits by James Clear</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. The Power of Atomic Habits</h2>
            <p>Clear explains that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Small changes and tiny behaviors can lead to significant results over time. Focus on making 1% improvements consistently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)</h2>
            <p>Our habits are intertwined with our identity. To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself. Building habits based on identity creates a solid foundation for lasting change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps</h2>
            <p>Clear introduces the habit loop: cue, craving, response, and reward. Understanding this loop helps in designing better habits and breaking bad ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. The Man Who Didn’t Look Right</h2>
            <p>Highlighting the story of a woman who saved her husband's life by noticing subtle cues, Clear emphasizes the importance of paying attention to the small signals that trigger our habits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit</h2>
            <p>Habit stacking and implementation intentions are effective strategies for starting new habits. Pairing a new habit with an existing one creates a strong cue for the new behavior.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More</h2>
            <p>Design your environment to make good habits easier and bad habits harder. Environment plays a critical role in shaping behavior, often more so than motivation alone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. The Secret to Self-Control</h2>
            <p>Self-control is easier when you avoid tempting situations. By designing environments that minimize exposure to triggers, you can enhance self-control and maintain good habits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. How to Make a Habit Irresistible</h2>
            <p>Pairing habits with positive experiences (temptation bundling) and making them attractive increases the likelihood of sticking with them. Dopamine-driven rewards make habits more enticing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>9. The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits</h2>
            <p>Social norms and the influence of those around us significantly impact our habits. Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to develop.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>10. How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits</h2>
            <p>Identify the underlying causes of bad habits by understanding the cues and rewards that drive them. Replace bad habits with healthier alternatives that provide similar rewards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>11. Walk Slowly, But Never Backward</h2>
            <p>Focus on continuous improvement rather than perfection. Even small steps forward can lead to significant progress over time. Consistency is key to long-term success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>12. The Law of Least Effort</h2>
            <p>Make good habits easy and bad habits difficult. Reduce friction for behaviors you want to adopt and increase friction for those you want to avoid.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>13. How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule</h2>
            <p>Break tasks into smaller actions that can be completed in two minutes or less. This makes it easier to start and overcome procrastination.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>14. How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible</h2>
            <p>Use commitment devices to lock in future behavior. Automate and set up systems that ensure good habits are followed and bad habits are avoided.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>15. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change</h2>
            <p>What is immediately rewarded is repeated, and what is immediately punished is avoided. Use immediate rewards to reinforce good habits and immediate consequences to discourage bad ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>16. How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day</h2>
            <p>Habit tracking and visual cues help maintain consistency. Seeing progress visually can be motivating and reinforce the habit loop.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>17. How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything</h2>
            <p>Accountability partners provide social reinforcement and can help you stay committed to your habits. Regular check-ins with someone who supports your goals can increase your chances of success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>18. The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)</h2>
            <p>While genetics can influence our abilities, habits shape our potential. Focus on building habits that align with your strengths and leverage your natural talents.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work</h2>
            <p>Maintain motivation by working on tasks that are just right in terms of difficulty—not too easy and not too hard. This keeps you engaged and challenged.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>20. The Downside of Creating Good Habits</h2>
            <p>Be aware of the potential downsides of habits, such as complacency and over-reliance on routines. Continually reassess and adjust your habits to ensure they are still serving your goals.</p>
