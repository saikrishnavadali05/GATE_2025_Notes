    <h1>Atomic Habits by James Clear</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. The Power of Atomic Habits</h2>
            <p>Clear explains that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Small changes and tiny behaviors can lead to significant results over time. Focus on making 1% improvements consistently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. The Four Laws of Behavior Change</h2>
            <p>Clear introduces a framework for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. This framework consists of four laws:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make it Obvious:</strong> Increase your awareness of your habits and their cues. Design your environment to make the cues of good habits more obvious.</li>
                <li><strong>Make it Attractive:</strong> Use temptation bundling and habit stacking to make habits more appealing.</li>
                <li><strong>Make it Easy:</strong> Reduce friction for good habits and increase friction for bad habits. Focus on starting small and building momentum.</li>
                <li><strong>Make it Satisfying:</strong> Use immediate rewards to reinforce good habits. Track your progress and celebrate small wins.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Habit Stacking</h2>
            <p>Link a new habit to an existing one. For example, "After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for two minutes." This helps to create a strong association and makes it easier to remember to perform the new habit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. The Two-Minute Rule</h2>
            <p>To make starting new habits easier, scale them down to just two minutes. The idea is to make the habit so simple that you can't say no. Once you start, it's easier to continue beyond the initial two minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Identity-Based Habits</h2>
            <p>Focus on the type of person you want to become rather than the outcomes you want to achieve. By aligning your habits with your identity, you create more lasting changes. For instance, instead of aiming to read a book, aim to become a reader.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. The Role of Environment</h2>
            <p>Your environment plays a significant role in shaping your habits. Design your environment to support your goals by removing triggers for bad habits and adding cues for good ones. This could involve reorganizing your living space or workplace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. Tracking and Reviewing</h2>
            <p>Regularly tracking your habits and reviewing your progress can help maintain momentum. Use habit trackers to visually represent your progress and motivate you to continue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Breaking Bad Habits</h2>
            <p>To break a bad habit, make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying. By reversing the four laws of behavior change, you can reduce the likelihood of engaging in bad habits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>9. Designing Your System</h2>
            <p>Focus on the systems and processes that lead to your goals rather than the goals themselves. By optimizing your system, you can achieve consistent and sustainable progress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>10. Mastering Your Habits</h2>
            <p>Understand that habit formation is a continuous process. Reflect on your habits regularly, make adjustments as needed, and strive for continuous improvement. Mastery comes from refining your habits over time.</p>
