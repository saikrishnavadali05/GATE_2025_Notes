    <h1>The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. You Are Not Your Mind</h2>
            <p>Tolle explains that much of our suffering comes from identifying too much with our minds. By observing our thoughts rather than becoming them, we can achieve greater peace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Consciousness: The Way Out of Pain</h2>
            <p>Living in the present moment and becoming more conscious can help us escape the pain created by our thoughts about the past and future. Awareness is the key to freedom.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Moving Deeply into the Now</h2>
            <p>To truly live in the now, we must let go of our attachment to time. This involves focusing our attention on the present moment and fully experiencing it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Mind Strategies for Avoiding the Now</h2>
            <p>The mind often distracts us from the present through worries, regrets, and daydreams. Recognizing and overcoming these distractions helps us stay grounded in the now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. The State of Presence</h2>
            <p>Presence is the state of being fully engaged and aware in the current moment. Achieving presence involves quieting the mind and embracing the simplicity of the now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. The Inner Body</h2>
            <p>Connecting with the inner body can deepen our sense of presence. By focusing on the sensations within our bodies, we can anchor ourselves in the present moment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. Portals into the Unmanifested</h2>
            <p>Tolle describes the unmanifested as the formless realm of pure being. By accessing this state through meditation and presence, we can experience a deeper sense of peace and connection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Enlightened Relationships</h2>
            <p>True enlightenment in relationships comes from being present and fully accepting ourselves and others. This reduces conflict and deepens our connections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>9. Beyond Happiness and Unhappiness There Is Peace</h2>
            <p>By transcending the duality of happiness and unhappiness, we can achieve a state of inner peace. This involves accepting whatever arises in the present moment without judgment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>10. The Meaning of Surrender</h2>
            <p>Surrendering to the present moment means accepting it as it is, without resistance. This doesn't mean giving up, but rather embracing what is and working with it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>11. The Inner Purpose of Your Life's Journey</h2>
            <p>Tolle explains that the primary purpose of your life is to be present and to be who you truly are. The outer purpose of your life will then align with this inner purpose, leading to fulfillment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>12. The Past Cannot Survive in Your Presence</h2>
            <p>The power of the present moment can dissolve the past and its pain. By staying present, we prevent the past from influencing our thoughts and actions.</p>
